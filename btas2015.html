      <p class="lead">Have you ever been frustrated by the time it takes to design, evaluate, and
      deploy a biometric algorithm? Us too!</p>
      <p>Over the past five years we’ve been working on, and benefiting from, a
      framework that streamlines the algorithm development process. We call this
      framework OpenBR, and the goal of this tutorial is to turn you into a believer!
      The main selling points of OpenBR include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A high-level grammar for composing algorithms and tuning parameters.</li>
        <li>A command line interface for algorithm training, evaluation, and deployment.</li>
        <li>A plugin framework for introducing new algorithm components.</li>
        <li>Hundreds of existing plugins for common algorithms (e.g., LBP, HOG,
            LDA, PCA, SVM, random sampling, illumination normalization, face detection,
            and landmark detection).</li>
        <li>A variety of standardized input and output formats.</li>
        <li>Automatic model file serialization and de-serialization.</li>
        <li>Automatic multi-threaded training, enrollment and comparison.</li>
        <li>Wrapper plugins for other popular open source and commercial libraries.</li>
        <li>Off-the-shelf algorithms for face recognition and gender/age estimation.</li>
        <li>Command line PDF plot generation for ROC, DET, CMC, etc. figures.</li>
        <li>A C++ API for custom application development.</li>
        <li>A library of GUI widgets for presenting OpenBR data.</li>
        <li>Support for Linux, OS X, and Windows operating systems.</li>
        <li>Daily activity on our repository and mailing list.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Josh</em> is a computer vision software engineer previously at MITRE,
            Michigan State University and Noblis, and currently a co-founder of Rank One Computing. He is the original
            author and lead developer of the OpenBR project. His professional interests
            include face recognition algorithm prototyping, large-scale image
            retrieval, and open source software engineering. Josh is also the author of
            <a href="http://www.liblikely.org">Likely</a>, an open source domain specific programming language for image
            recognition.</li>
        <li><em>Brendan</em> is a co-founder of Rank One Computing. Prior to this, Brendan founded the Visual Analytics Lab at Noblis.
            Brendan has published over 25 peer reviewed papers on the topic of automated face recognition.
            Brendan’s professional interests are in accurate algorithm design,
            and developing novel applications of face recognition technology. Brendan
            received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Michigan State University.</li>
        <li><em>Scott</em> is a computer vision research engineer is a co-founder of Rank One Computing. 
            He has shipped multiple biometric software
            systems, including the FaceSketchID System which was licensed to Safran
            Morpho in 2014. Scott has a passion for algorithm development and software
            engineering with an emphasis on creating technologies that are easily
            disseminated and integrated. He is the author of multiple publications,
            the majority of which relate to heterogeneous face recognition.</li>
        <li><em>Ben</em> is an engineer at Noblis. He primarily works on developing and improving
            frameworks for face detection and recognition evaluation. Ben
            helped to implement the Janus API in the OpenBR project.</li>
        <li><em>Jordan</em> is a software engineer at Noblis. He recently graduated from
            Swarthmore College with degrees in Computer Science and Engineering.
            Currently he is focused on face detection and expanding the OpenBR
            project.</li>
